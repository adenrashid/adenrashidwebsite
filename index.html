    <p>
        <div>Hey! I'm Aden.</div> 
        <br>
        I have always enjoyed tech. Ever since I was young, I loved computers. My brother and I would argue about who would get to spend more time on our family desktop whether it was to browse the internet, play games, solve puzzles, or learn more about what a computer could do. 
        <br><br>
        I've also always loved playing creative sandbox games such as The Sims, RollerCoaster/Zoo Tycoon, and Minecraft. I liked the idea of creating and building, then being able to enjoy the end product. 
        <br><br>
        As I got older I discovered Myspace. I would spend countless hours designing my webpage, customizing the HTML and CSS, and absolutely loving it. I have always been creative and I found that this was a great outlet for me. 
        <br><br>
        When it came time to choose what I wanted to do, I went for dentistry because I thought it was a great blend of problem solving and creativity. I worked as a dentist for close to 3 years, but found that I wanted more from my career.  
        <br><br>
        At the same time that I was working as a dentist, I was teaching myself to code. I was doing tutorials on Codecademy, watching videos on Youtube, building my personal website, working on small problem solving projects, and loving it. 
        <br><br>
        The problem solving aspect of dentistry as well as the attention to detail tied in perfectly with coding, and for me it was a natural progression. 
        <br><br>
        I didn't realize that I could make what I've always enjoyed into my career, until now. I've never felt more passionate about who I am or what I want to do. 
        <br><br>
        I believe I am fun, hard-working, and determined. I'm easy to work with, a really quick learner, and I get things done!
